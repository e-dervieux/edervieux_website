This personal site is meant to serve as a hub for the different [projects](/projects) I spend my time on. In particular, you'll find links below to my [*Curiculum Vitæ*](https://github.com/e-dervieux/curriculum_vitae/releases/latest/download/cv.pdf), as well as my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=DCR_h9YAAAAJ), [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emmanuel-Dervieux-2), and [GitHub](https://github.com/e-dervieux) pages.

 

If you came here for the Jellyfin server, [check out the dedicated page](/projects/jellyfin)!
